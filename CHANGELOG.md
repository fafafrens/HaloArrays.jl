# Changelog

All notable changes to HaloArrays.jl are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0]

### Added
- **`FunctionBC`** — a custom per-field boundary condition from a plain function,
  running inside `synchronize_halo!` like a built-in and on every backend (single,
  MPI, threaded). Called per face as `f(ghost, edge, side, dim, hw, origin)`, where
  `origin` is the global `CartesianIndex` of the ghost slab — so position-dependent
  conditions are a broadcast that stays correct under MPI/thread decomposition and
  runs on GPU. One mechanism now covers value-, gradient-, and position-based BCs;
  cross-field conditions remain `apply_coupled_bc!`.
- **Multi-GPU MPI example** (`examples/heat/multigpu_mpi_2d.jl`): one MPI rank per
  GPU, a device-resident `HaloArray`, and GPU-to-GPU **CUDA-aware-MPI** halo
  exchange — **validated on CINECA Leonardo** (1 and 4× A100, global `‖u‖₂`
  bit-identical to the CPU reference).
- **`examples/heat/RUNNING_ON_LEONARDO.md`** — a tested HPC deployment recipe
  (system OpenMPI + system parallel HDF5 + CUDA local toolkit + `srun --mpi=pmix_v3`).
- **`Adapt.jl` support** — move a `HaloArray` between host and device (`cu(halo)` /
  `adapt`), with device-following halo buffers.
- **LinearSolve / Krylov extension** — matrix-free solvers that operate directly on
  halo arrays as coordinate-free vectors: `HaloKrylov`, `HaloCG`, `HaloBiCGStab`,
  `HaloMINRES`, `HaloGMRES`.
- **`norm` for `MultiHaloArray` / `ArrayOfHaloArray` / `MaybeHaloArray`.**

### Changed
- **Kernel-region types renamed** for clarity ("region" now reads as a *range*
  concept; these are positioned launch windows): `CellKernelRegion`→`CellWindow`,
  `FaceKernelRegion`→`FaceWindow`, and the 2-colored (red-black) variants
  `ColoredCellKernelRegion`→`CellCheckerboard`, `ColoredFaceKernelRegion`→
  `FaceCheckerboard`. Accessors follow suit: `get_*_region`→`get_*_window` and
  `get_colored_*_region`→`get_*_checkerboard`.
- **HDF5 is now a weak dependency** (`HaloArraysHDF5Ext`): `using HaloArrays` no
  longer pulls in HDF5 (and its MPI-built JLLs, which clash with a system
  CUDA-aware MPI). The I/O API loads only when you `using HDF5`.
- Examples use a single KernelAbstractions path for both CPU and GPU (removed the
  hand-written CPU scalar loops).
- `to_bc` (boundary-condition normalization) now uses multiple dispatch instead of
  an `if`/`isa` ladder, so a new `:symbol` shortcut can be registered by an
  extension via `to_bc(::Val{:name})` without editing the package.
- README trimmed to essentials.

### Performance
- Fast contiguous `@simd` interior reductions for `sum`/`dot`/`norm` (~5× on the
  matrix-free Krylov path), gated on `::Array` parents so GPU parents keep a
  device-side fallback.
- BLAS-1 contiguous SIMD kernels for `axpy!`/`axpby!`/`rmul!`/`lmul!` on `Array`
  parents; `swap!`/`rotate!`/`reflect!` made GPU-safe.
- Collection and `dot` reductions are now zero-allocation.

### Fixed
- Closed an `O(N)` hot-path allocation leak in collection/`Maybe` `norm`.
- Multi-GPU example world-age error (load the GPU package at top level).
- Keep interior reductions GPU-safe (SIMD only for `Array` parents).
- CI: documentation `@autodocs` source-file selection and the MPI-test environment
  updated for the HDF5 weak-dependency move; bumped Node-20 GitHub Actions to
  Node-24 versions.

## [0.1.0]

- Initial version: `LocalHaloArray`, `ThreadedHaloArray`, and MPI `HaloArray`
  behind one halo-exchange API; multi-field containers; boundary conditions
  (periodic, reflecting, antireflecting, repeating, custom, coupled); global
  reductions; `gather` and HDF5 output; OrdinaryDiffEq integration; thread-backend
  abstraction (OhMyThreads / Serial / Polyester); KernelAbstractions GPU path.
